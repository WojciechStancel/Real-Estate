Welcome to the WS Real Estate Agency web application. This application is built using Django for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend. It serves as a platform for managing real estate listings, allowing users to browse and add property listings, as well as providing authentication and registration features. The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database, and it is hosted on AWS with Nginx as the web server.
